Insurance is a contract that provides financial protection against potential future losses or risks. It involves a policyholder paying regular premiums to an insurance company.
In return, the insurer agrees to compensate the policyholder in case of specified losses. Common types include health, life, auto, home, and travel insurance.
Life insurance provides financial support to beneficiaries after the policyholder's death. Health insurance covers medical expenses due to illness or injury. Auto insurance protects against vehicle damage or third-party liabilities. Insurance helps individuals and businesses manage risks and maintain financial stability. Premium amounts are based on risk factors like age, health, and claim history. Having insurance reduces the financial burden during emergencies or unexpected events. Insurance works on the principle of risk pooling, where many people contribute to a common fund. This fund is used to compensate those who experience covered losses. The insurance industry is regulated by government authorities to protect consumers.
